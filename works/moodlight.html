			<span class = "rainbow_element">MoodLight is a prototype wearable +
			mobile app that expresses the user's current mood.</span> You have
			three selections: happy, sad, and angry. Although limited, the
			project's main goal is to encourage the user be more willing to
			<span class = "rainbow_element">express their mood in a honest and
			explicit manner</span>. In an age where emotional health and
			communication are becoming increasingly important, this project aims
			to assist those efforts.

			There are two parts to this, one part is an 8x8 superbright LED
			matrix controlled by a rainbowduino which communicates with a mobile
			app via a BLE module. The mobile app was made using PhoneGap
			Cordova. The app is just a single HTML/CSS webpage using some
			javascript to send signals to the bluetooth module to control the
			LED display.
