		<p>
			MoodLight! is a wearable+mobile app that expresses the user's current mood. You have three selections:
			happy, sad, and angry. Although limited, the project's main goal is to encourage the user be more willing to express
			their mood in a honest and explicit manner. In an age where emotional health and communication are becoming
			increasingly important, this project aims to assist those efforts.

		<h1>How it works</h1>
		<p>
			There are two parts to this, one part is an 8x8 superbright LED matrix controlled by a rainbowduino which communicates to the second part via
			a BLE module. The second part is a mobile app that was made using PhoneGap Cordova. The app is just a single HTML/CSS webpage using some
			javascript to send signals to the bluetooth module to control the LED display.
