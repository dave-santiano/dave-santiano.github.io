			The Trump Twitter Trasher is a photograph of Donald Trump that has been modified by me to spit out his inane tweets into
			the trash(which will then be recycled). It works by a Node.js server utilizing the Twitter API to grab tweets from Donald Trump’s
			twitter stream and then storing them, the stored tweets are then used to populate an HTML page served
			by the website where they will be selected to be put into the trash. Here's a quick video demo:

		The technology used was a Node.js server running on the back-end, which served up an HTML page and also communicated with
		an Arduino via serial communication for the purposes of printing the tweets. The basic flow of information was: Twitter
		—> Node.js server —> HTML page with buttons for selection —> back to node.js server —> Arduino —> Receipt Printer —> Trash
