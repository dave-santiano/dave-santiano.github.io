						This project was a gigantic undertaking for two people, but very much well worth it in the end. Nick and I aimed to simulate a fighting game in After Effects, placing ourselves and our classmates as the characters. Stylistically, we planned on making it an old arcade style fighter, heavy on the pixel-art and cheesy special attacks. In some ways we made it too realistic, as when we showed it to our friends the pacing of it and the detail of the start menus prompted them to want to press on the buttons in the animation, causing them to pause the video or mess up the playback.
					</p>
					<h2>More details? Yes please, I'll also take the check!</h2>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						So we first started with setting up a green screen and filming ourselves doing all the special moves that we wanted to do in the animation. We had a list of punches, kicks, jabs, energy ball throws, and much more that we consulted in order to get what we needed for our characters.

						Next came making actual in game assets, two of which I worked on were making a legitimate looking and rigged up health bar, and also the friend gods that would deliver onto the Nick the power of the rainbow.

						All of the assets and animations in the first half before the fight should be accredited to Nicholas Sanchez. I had the task of working on the fight animation, planning the choreography, special effects, and all the little details present in it. This involved a lot of chopping, editing, layering, and watching a ton of tutorials on how to get certain effects like the rainbow beams and the kamehameha just right. To give you an idea on the amount of layers and assets we had to deal with:

						There was a lot of chopping, layering, and sliding around that I had to do for the fight, and it was a huge amount of work to get everything just the way we wanted it. Overall, we were and are very happy with the result! I think people trying to place the game itself when they watched the video on their phones says something about the amount of detail that was placed in.
