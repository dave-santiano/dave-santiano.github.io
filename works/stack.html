			stack. is a working prototype for a device that can <span class =
			"rainbow_element">help people with visual disabilities</span> to
			create simple 3D models using the tactility of Legoes. Utilizing
			OpenCV, Unity3D, and a Lego board, the user can prototype simple
			cube-based models that they create layer by layer. Here is a quick
			video:

			We used a Processing 3.0 flavor of OpenCV to do color detection on a
			grid-divided Lego board. If there was a Lego detected within one of
			the squares then a signal was sent to Unity3D via OSC that a Lego
			piece is now occupying that portion of the grid, and a 3D cube was
			then rendered in the relevant square on the field in Unity3D.

			We used simple controls, with a button to go up a layer, and another
			one to go down a layer, and then one that theoretically exports it
			as a 3D model so that it can be 3D printed.
