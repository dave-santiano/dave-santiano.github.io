						CELEBRATE WOMEN is a photo series that was done for International Women's day on March 8th. The creative lead and creator of the idea was <a href = "http://nicolechan.org/">Nicole Chan</a>, who does extraordinary social activism work with her photography. What we did was open up a sign-up sheet and schedule people who identify as women for a photoshoot with them and something that empowers them. We asked them to write us a statement on why the object inspired them and placed it as the caption underneath the photo along with a "#CELEBRATEWOMEN". For a bit more info, check out the Facebook event page <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/events/922536214531601/">here.</a>
