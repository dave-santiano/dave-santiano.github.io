						Won in the accessibility track at HackNYU. This is a piece of tech that allows people with a visual disability to design and create simple 3D models with their sense of touch! My laptop is using Processing's OpenCV library and a webcam to detect where Legos are being placed on a board. Processing's osc library then sends some data over to Unity where blocks are placed down on a virtual field.

						<h2>The Ingredients!</h2>

							<li>Processing 3.0</li>
							<li>osc library (for communication)</li>
							<li>OpenCV library (for vision)</li>
							<li>Unity3D</li>
							<li>Legos</li>
							<li>Webcam</li>

					    So this tool is something that evolved from a final I had to do for a class called interaction lab. Early versions of it stemmed from exploring Arduino to Unity interaction, but then I decided to scrap the Arduino aspect and play around with how computer vision could be integrated with Unity. I was inspired by <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYW763HaLQE">TRANSFORM: Nature and Machine</a>, a project from the Tangible Media group at the MIT Media Lab. I thought that going from the virtual to the physical was amazing, but then I thought reversing the process, physical to virtual, would be a fun exercise in interactivity.

						Like with a lot of work, new ideas tend to appear post-creation, and it wasn't until HackNYU that me and my team thought of a new way to implement this piece of tech. Reimplementing and modifying the code, we managed to muster up a way for it to be used for people with visual impairments!

						This is how the webcam itself looks at the field of Legos. What's nice about the Logitech webcam we used was that all of the in camera settings are adjustable via the Logitech webcam software. Adjusting these settings I could increase the contrast and make colors stand out more when sitting on a gray-scale field.

						I still want to pursue this project even further, and to implement saving the models made in Unity as files waiting to be 3D printed. It sort of comes full circle this way, with the physical going to virtual and then back to physical again.
