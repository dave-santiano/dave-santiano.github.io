						This was something that I cooked up for a midterm for a class called Talking Fabrics, taught by the great Antonius Wiriadjaja. I wanted to imitate the <a href ="https://itp.nyu.edu/shows/winter2012/firewall/">Firewall</a> at ITP, and try to find out how the whole thing worked conceptually. I figured that all you would need is a projector, some spandex, and a Kinect to grab elevation data from the spandex being depressed. It turns out it really was that straightforward! A lot of help and guidance also came from ITP assistant <a href="http://moqn.net/">Moon!</a>

						<h2>The Ingredients!</h2>
						<ul class = "grocerylist">
							<li>Processing 3.0</li>
							<li>Kinect for Windows</li>
							<li>OpenCV library (for vision)</li>
							<li>Spandex</li>
							<li>Legos</li>
							<li>Webcam</li>
							<li>A Projector</li>
							<li>A mighty hammer for hammering Legos</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>More Details!</h2>

						The original Firewall was obviously much more refined, much bigger than mine, and better (didn't have Legos though), but I got the basic functionality behind it done. Drawing on it is pretty straightforward, when you press lightly the color splotch is small, and when you press harder and pass more of the distance threshold you'll make a bigger color splotch.

						I'm planning on doing a lot of things with this now that I have the basic framework of the interactive wall done. I've always been interested in maps and such, and I want to make an interactive map maker with this when I find the time! And also when I get back to Shanghai and can get my hands on a Kinect again AND my Legos. You can find the code for my project<a href ="https://github.com/dave-santiano/kinect_living_wall">here</a>. Make sure you have a Kinect and some Legos! Also some spandex ;)
