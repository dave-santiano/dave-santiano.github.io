            What this project is focusing on is how AI can be used to work hand
            in hand with an activity that is inherently special to human beings,
            the creation of music. We are attemping to go beyond the novelty of
            an artificial intelligence-based performance and focusing on how AI
            can accompany, assist, and respond to our creative process.

			Projects of this type have already been done before with other
			instruments, frequently with a piano, as MIDI input is simple and
			easy to do with a plug and play piano keyboard. What we instead
			wanted to do was create a digital theremin using a LeapMotion for
			hand detection and tracking, mainly for the ease of input and a lack
			of tools/resources for creating an actual theremin (but that's
			potentially on the to-do list), and then input it as MIDI into a
			pretrained neural network using Google Magenta.
		</p>
		<p>
			The user simply waves their hands above the LeapMotion, and after
			they stop playing the neural network generates a melody to be played
			back to them with the tone and style of a theremin. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The relationship that we wanted to establish with this AI was one
			used for the purpose of breaking patterns. Neural networks often
			give unexpected outputs that outwit even the most experienced GO
			players, so my hypothesis is that AI can offer up patterns and
			inspirations that go beyond even the immense amount of knowledge
			that an experienced musician would be familiar with. This would go
			beyond listening to new music for inspiration, it's listening to a
			new understanding of music for inspiration.
