            The Modal Camera is an experiment in mapping the brightness of a
            captured image to a modal scale. Some musicians would equate the
            amount of flats or sharps within a scale to the brightness of its
            sound. Lydian has a #4, making it the brightest. Locrian is the
            darkest, as it has a b2, b3, b5, b6, and b7. You could list them
            from brightest to darkest like so:
		</p>
        <ol>
            <li class = "rainbow_element">Lydian (#4)</li>
            <li class = "rainbow_element">Ionian</li>
            <li class = "rainbow_element">Mixolydian (b7)</li>
            <li class = "rainbow_element">Dorian (b3, b7)</li>
            <li class = "rainbow_element">Aeolian (b3, b6, b7)</li>
            <li class = "rainbow_element">Phrygian (b2, b3, b6, b7)</li>
            <li class = "rainbow_element">Locrian (b2, b3, b5, b6, b7)</li>
        </ol>
		<p>
            In terms of what's going on in the background, I just average out
            the brightness value of all the pixels in the image, and then
            arbitrarily map that brightness value to one of the modal scales.
