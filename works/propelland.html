					<span class="rainbow_element">Vitro Samples</span> e-commerce platform
				</p>
				<p class="project-description">
					Lead a project to help <span class="rainbow_element">Vitro Architectural Glass</span> update their
					Samples Shopify website. <span class = "rainbow_element">The project
					primarily focused on providing front-end updates to enhance their
					back-office reporting and data analysis capabilities.</span> We did
					this by enhancing <span class="rainbow_element">customer identification during the checkout
					process</span>, and establishing new rules and restrictions based on
					different types of customers. For the back-office reports we wrote
					<span class="rainbow_element">Mechanic scripts</span> to clean up incoming order reports to fit Vitro's
					standard nomenclature, and to also alert Vitro staff of the ordering
					of specific types of items.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="demo-section">
				<p class="project-description">
					The updates to the website allowed for Vitro to start running
					<span class="rainbow_element">analyses on the data</span> that they have gathered so far, and past data
					that we were able to access and clean up for them. <span class =
					"rainbow_element">This enabled Vitro staff to more accurately
					analyze metrics</span> such as what popular products and samples are
					being ordered, which companies they are being shipped to, etc. 
				</p>
				<p class="project-description">
					We also completed the development of <span class =
					"rainbow_element">two dashboards that would allow Vitro to track and
					calculate different OTIF (On Time and In Full), orders, and
					inventory metrics.</span> Vitro is a company that is in the midst of
					<span class="rainbow_element">digitization</span>, and the dashboards combined with the website updates
					unlocked new datapoints and analyses that would enable Vitro to make
					better decisions within the market for their products.

				<p class="project-description">
					We <span class = "rainbow_element">prototyped a wellness app</span>
					for a company that is trying to transition into the wellness space.
					I programmed the app in a low-code framework called <span class =
					"rainbow_element">Bubble</span>, with assets created by our visual
					design team. The app had an <span class="rainbow_element">API connection to Google Health</span> which
					allowed for us to demo a functioning prototype that could display
					simple metrics about the user's health. <span class =
					"rainbow_element">Our demo primarily focused on the on-boarding
					process, and then screens that could be looked at in tandem with a
					user journey.</span>

					interactive guides</span>, voice-overs for training videos, and documents
					that could be accessed to learn about one of Coca-Cola's internal
					management systems. I helped with <span class="rainbow_element">recording voice-overs</span> and creating
