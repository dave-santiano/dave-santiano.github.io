			Vitro Samples
		</p>
		<p>
			Lead a project to help Vitro Architectural Glass update their
			Samples Shopify website. <span class = "rainbow_element">The project
			primarily focused on providing front-end updates to enhance their
			back-office reporting and data analysis capabilities.</span> We did
			this by enhancing customer identification during the checkout
			process, and establishing new rules and restrictions based on
			different types of customers. For the back-office reports we wrote
			Mechanic scripts to clean up incoming order reports to fit Vitro's
			standard nomenclature, and to also alert Vitro staff of the ordering
			of specific types of items.
		</p>
		<p>
			The updates to the website allowed for Vitro to start running
			analyses on the data that they have gathered so far, and past data
			that we were able to access and clean up for them. <span class =
			"rainbow_element">This enabled Vitro staff to more accurately
			analyze metrics</span> such as what popular products and samples are
			being ordered, which companies they are being shipped to, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also completed the development of <span class =
			"rainbow_element">two dashboards that would allow Vitro to track and
			calculate different OTIF (On Time and In Full), orders, and
			inventory metrics.</span> Vitro is a company that is in the midst of
			digitization, and the dashboards combined with the website updates
			unlocked new datapoints and analyses that would enable Vitro to make
			better decisions on the market for their products.

		<img class = "project_image" style="width: 400px;" src = "../../techimg/mood_thumb.png">
		<p>
			We <span class = "rainbow_element">prototyped a wellness app</span> for a
			company that is trying to transition into the wellness space. I
			programmed the app in a low-code framework called <span class = "rainbow_element">Bubble</span>, with
			assets created by our visual design team. The app had an API
			connection to Google Health which allowed for us to demo a
			functioning prototype that could display simple metrics about the
			user's health. <span class = "rainbow_element">Our demo primarily focused on the on-boarding
			process, and then screens that could be looked at in tandem with a
			user journey.</span>
		</p>

		<img class = "project_image" src = "../../techimg/coca-cola.png">
		<p>
			Helped during the redesign and creation of training materials for
			Coca-Cola staff. <span class = "rainbow_element">We designed,
			tested, and then wireframed new training materials and SharePoint
			websites</span> that were shipped to Coca-Cola for integration in
			their internal operations. The materials consisted of Figma-based
			interactive guides, voice-over video, and documents that could be
			accessed to learn about one of Coca-Cola's internal management
			systems.
		</p>

		<img class = "project_image" src = "../../techimg/vuereal.jpg">
		<p>
			Helped an architectural glass company with technological
			verification and roadmapping for a new investment into a <span class
			= "rainbow_element">Micro-LED company named VueReal</span>, and how
			their Micro-LED technology technology could be integrated into
			existing and future projects. I helped with research and into how
			this technology could be used in the short, medium, and long-term
			technological horizons within various industries such as
			construction, automotive, or healthcare.
