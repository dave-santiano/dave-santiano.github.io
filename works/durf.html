		<h1>Seeing Assistive Robotic Arm</h1>

			The assistive robotic arm was an exploration into finding new and
			simple ways for robotics to be used in assistive tech. This is both
			a working prototype and a proof of concept, just a <span class =
			"rainbow_element">simple robotic arm with a webcam attached to it,
			using computer vision, an arduino, and software called head mouse to
			find and then grab certain objects.</span> With this you can control
			and move the robotic arm with just the use of your head.

			A bit of a peek into how the computer was processing the video feed.
			We drew a small crosshair as an overlay in order to visualize what
			areas of the feed were being detected. If the color it was looking
			for was not fully centered, the arm would send instructions to the
			micro-controller to move and center accordingly.
