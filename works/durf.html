		<h1>Seeing Assistive Robotic Arm</h1>
		2016/Assistive Tech/Prototype

			The assistive robotic arm was an exploration into finding new ways
			for robotics to be used in assistive tech over the Summer of 2016.
			This is both a working prototype and a proof of concept, just a
			simple robotic arm with a webcam attached to it, using computer
			vision, an arduino, and head mouse to find and then grab certain
			objects. With this you can control and move the robotic arm with
			just the use of your head.

			We originally wanted to use a high quality Logitech webcam, but then
			elected to go for a smaller, cheaper, and also lighter webcam that
			the robotic arm could handle.

			A bit of a peek into how the computer was processing the video feed.
			We drew a small crosshair as an overlay in order to visualize what
			areas of the feed were being detected. If the color it was looking
			for was not fully centered, the arm would send instructions to the
			Arduino micro-controller to move and center accordingly.
