				<h1>Web Development Midterm, Happy Halloween! </h1>

						Happy Halloween! So with the semi-completion of this website comes a reflection/devlog of how it came to be, what it needs, interesting roadblocks etc. etc. It's been pretty fun so far, visual projects have always been my favorite since changes and iterations are immediately visible, and the tiniest of details can make huge differences.
					</p>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						What I tried to do with this was make a site inspired by ITP fellow Moon's portfolio website: <a href = "http://moqn.net/">www.moqn.net</a> I got the basic structure similar but then I saw another website that inspired me in a more visual sense, musician and artist Disasterpeace: <a href = "http://disasterpeace.com/">disasterpeace.com</a>. I loved the simple visual style to it, and decided to go about imitating it but with my own personal flare.
					</p>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						I animated some icons and a stand-in logo to give the website a bit of dynamic and "quirkiness" so that it was friendly and immediately showcased a tiny fraction of the work that I like to do. It's relatively simple, and honestly the structure of the website is relatively the same amount of complexity as the in-class CSS polaroid thumbnail example. I think I've grasped the concepts of everything pretty well though, and the next steps are what I think will challenge me a bit more and really take the website to the next level.
					</p>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						The future things that I'll be working on is having the landing page image be a photo of a random project that has been finished or one that I am currently working on. I also want to add an additional animation that will provide textual information to the navigation icons on mouse hover. I'll also be adding animated loading icons to take care of the dreadful photo loading screen swipe thing.

						This website has been a long time coming, but it's nice to see all the work I've been doing put together in a nice package for people. I guess with the website comes this first post on my blog, and a new milestone on the work I've been doing. Here I'll be posting my thoughts on just general stuff, just in case anyone cares enough to keep up with me. I'll get a bit nostalgic from time to time and post a reflection on work I've already done, and how I came to execute and achieve it. If you want more detail this is the place to find it!
					</p>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						Keep in mind the portfolio isn't 100% complete yet! I'm still adding stuff, so be sure to check back later if you've stumbled upon this and found it lacking.
