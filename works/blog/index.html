						I'm going to place a secret code in javascript that activates animations and other cool stuff! I've been working on my website for the last month, and I'm not ready to get another domain name and start from scratch again, and I'd like to add a little summin summin to the website to give viewers a way to interact with it in an interesting and fun way.

				<h1>Some reflections and meditations</h1>
				<div class = "postinfo">November 16, 2016</div>
				<div>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						From time to time I I'll just post some of my thoughts and reflections on certain things that matter to me. There are two objectives to this: pollute the thoughtosphere of the internet with even MORE opinions and thoughts, and to have a visualization of how I grow as a person and how my thoughts and processes evolve.
					</p>
					
					<p class ="postcontent">
						So to start it off, child-like exploration.
					</p>

					<p class ="postcontent">
						Children are lucky. Extremely lucky. They can encounter the world before them with fresh eyes, as if it was being created right before them. They see a train or firetruck as a modern marvel, or skyscrapers as huge monoliths that leave them in awe. It's not just the awe that is felt that makes this type of exploration amazing, but what questions arise whenever we encounter something new. "Can I break it?" "Can I eat it?" "Is it  pliable, malleable, bendable?" "What does it feel like" "What does it smell like?" "Can I use it to hit someone else?" "Will it hurt the other person if I hit them with it?" "Can I carry it?" "Can I move it?" "Can I interact with it?" "Will it respond to my words or touch?" etc. etc. And then comes the questions that lead to new and interesting ideas and figments, the what-if questions. "What if I could carry it?" "What size would it be for it to be carry-able?" "What if it was malleable?" "What if I could interact with it?" "What if it answered back when I talked to it?"  These sorts of questions, and the actions we take to answer them, are all things that can keep the world interesting, our imaginations fresh and new, and keep us learning as well.
					</p>

					<p class ="postcontent">
						The process of asking these child-like questions, answering them, and then using your skills as an experienced adult to create something new and fresh is just one of many possible creative processes. What if trees could talk? Well I could build an Arduino powered pseudo-robot that could make the tree answer questions about it's personal health based on soil, water, and climate data. What if I could bend and mold this desk? Maybe I can create a desk that has the ability to be changed in an organic way, so that it can be optimized for my proportions and my work style.
					</p>

					<p class ="postcontent">
						Don't be afraid to ask these questions to yourself, it's not a sign of foolishness or ignorance of the world, but a way of answering back to your inner child as the experienced and worldly adult you are, and to say: "Yeah, we can totally do that."

						Damn, senior year is almost over and Donald Trump has become President elect of The United States of America. Congratulations Donald, but I do have to say I am disappointed with the results. However, the election season provides an excellent segue into an idea that I will be developing in the coming weeks. The story that we are all living right now, real live history, is something that a lot of people don't particularly participate in. It's like a choose your own adventure book, but a lot of people are just watching a few people play, letting them decide where the story goes. 
					</p>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						I feel that part of this has to do with the annoyance and lack of immediacy in the voting populace. Election news is tiring, it's mainstream media driven, and it's something that starts to be quite annoying after a while. What it lacks is a sense of impact, a sense of participating in the history of the here and now. So that brings me to something that I will be prototyping these next few weeks.
					</p>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						What I want to do is a crowd-sourced choose your own adventure game, determined by a vote of yes or no. What will happen is that political issues in a fictional timeline will be delivered to your phone to be voted on. The majority vote of yes or no will determine the next events that will happen in the story. The masses determine the course of this fictional history, and the consequences for their actions will be immediately seen.
					</p>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						This is going to require a few things to work though. The number one thing is to have a compelling story with good writing, something that will contain tropes and content that are relatable to actual modern history. The design of the content, from the font to the color scheme to possible music is something that will only add to the emotion and atmosphere that the writing will try to convey. The technical side of things is relatively easy, it can all be made in a simple web application, with content being delivered on a weekly basis after it's been produced. 
					</p>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						Technology as a form of storytelling is still something that is relatively new, especially in the sense of using phone applications and the internet as a medium for storytelling. Hopefully this can explore some of the ways we can transform a phone or personal computing device into an object that can become an artifact from another world, a tool that influences fictional events, and also give people the sense of power and consequence that results from casting their vote on issues and officials.

				<h1>Web Development Midterm, Happy Halloween! </h1>
				<div class = "postinfo">October 31, 2016</div>
				<div>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						Happy Halloween! So with the semi-completion of this website comes a reflection/devlog of how it came to be, what it needs, interesting roadblocks etc. etc. It's been pretty fun so far, visual projects have always been my favorite since changes and iterations are immediately visible, and the tiniest of details can make huge differences.
					</p>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						What I tried to do with this was make a site inspired by ITP fellow Moon's portfolio website: <a href = "http://moqn.net/">www.moqn.net</a> I got the basic structure similar but then I saw another website that inspired me in a more visual sense, musician and artist Disasterpeace: <a href = "http://disasterpeace.com/">disasterpeace.com</a>. I loved the simple visual style to it, and decided to go about imitating it but with my own personal flare.
					</p>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						I animated some icons and a stand-in logo to give the website a bit of dynamic and "quirkiness" so that it was friendly and immediately showcased a tiny fraction of the work that I like to do. It's relatively simple, and honestly the structure of the website is relatively the same amount of complexity as the in-class CSS polaroid thumbnail example. I think I've grasped the concepts of everything pretty well though, and the next steps are what I think will challenge me a bit more and really take the website to the next level.
					</p>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						The future things that I'll be working on is having the landing page image be a photo of a random project that has been finished or one that I am currently working on. I also want to add an additional animation that will provide textual information to the navigation icons on mouse hover. I'll also be adding animated loading icons to take care of the dreadful photo loading screen swipe thing.

				<h1>And then there was web.</h1>

					<p class = "postcontent">
						This website has been a long time coming, but it's nice to see all the work I've been doing put together in a nice package for people. I guess with the website comes this first post on my blog, and a new milestone on the work I've been doing. Here I'll be posting my thoughts on just general stuff, just in case anyone cares enough to keep up with me. I'll get a bit nostalgic from time to time and post a reflection on work I've already done, and how I came to execute and achieve it. If you want more detail this is the place to find it!
					</p>
					<p class = "postcontent">
						Keep in mind the portfolio isn't 100% complete yet! I'm still adding stuff, so be sure to check back later if you've stumbled upon this and found it lacking.
