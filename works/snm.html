			This collaboration with Sleep No More Shanghai aimed to augment a
			couple of their New Year's Party performances with <span class="rainbow_element">
			real-time graphics and projection mapping from TouchDesigner. </span>

			The theme of the last night of the year was surrealism and Georges
			Méliès' "A Trip To The Moon". Building upon that theme led to
			<span class="rainbow_element">projection mapping a photorealistic
			and audio-reactive moon</span> that would usher the audience into
			the new year, and then a giant moving eye appearing to greet them.
			New Year's countdown also included!
		</p>

			In another room of the McKinnon Hotel we painted a former hospital
			room with <span class="rainbow_element">projection mapped
			clouds from TouchDesigner</span>, transporting guests into a room-scale cloudscape that
			played along with the traveling performers.
