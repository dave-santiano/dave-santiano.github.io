			Lately I've become enamored by the idea of microprinting. Human
			perception, although amazing, is pretty limited when placed in
			contest with some of the more specially evolved organisms on the
			planet. Microscopic levels of scale are a quick method to reveal to
			oneself just how limited our eyesight can be, albeit in only the
			category of scale.
		</p>
		<p>
			Funnily enough, the main inspiration here was not in
			micro-organisms, but in the security features of money. I find them
			to be quite beautiful, with geometric patterns and hidden images
			abound. Take the American dollar for example, with hidden text
			nestled in between the tiny printed lines.
