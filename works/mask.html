		<h1>Anti-Facial Recognition Mask</h1>

            In many places in the world <span class =
            "rainbow_element">facial recognition
            technology</span> is being used  for a variety of purposes. Catching
            wrong-doers within a crowd of ten thousand and finding lost children
            in the giant Shanghai city metro system are all noble pursuits, but
            it comes at the cost of our <span class =
            "rainbow_element">biometric data</span> being stored in giant
            databases. Although this technology advances quite rapidly, there
            are ways to counteract it using cheap and low-tech methods. 
        </p>

            Rudimentary facial recognition is usually done by feature mapping,
            simply finding pixels that match the general features of a face
            within an image and returning it's position within it. However, these 
            techniques usually yield inconsistent results with many false positives.
            Now, with advancements in <span
            class = "rainbow_element">machine learning based image analysis and
            3D capture systems</span>, facial recognition has become more robust and
            accurate. Now, 3D models of faces can be stored and then used to
            train this technology to become more accurate and robust, with very little
            false positives.
        </p>
        <img  src = "../techimg/retro-3.jpg" class = "project_image">
        <p>
            In order to disrupt this technology I came up with the idea of a
            mask that not only obscures the face, but also <span class =
            "rainbow_element">disrupts and obscures the depth data</span> being
            received by these volumetric facial recognition cameras. Most
            volumetric capture systems utilize
            <span class = "rainbow_element">infrared light projectors</span> to
            calculate depth. Because of this, it is often advised not to have
            reflective surfaces when conducting volumetric capture. <span
            class = "rainbow_element">Exploiting
            this weakness is the idea behind the anti-surveillance mask</span>. <span
            class = "rainbow_element">Retro-reflective material</span> heavily
            reflects back the infrared patterns emitted by the infrared
            projector on a depth camera, flooding the camera with garbage data.
            This results in a hole being created on the retro-reflective
            material part of the point cloud.
        </p>
        <img src = "../techimg/retro-2.gif" class = "project_image">
        <p>
            What results is a mask that not only obscures the face, but adds
            another layer of security to an individual's personal biometric data.
