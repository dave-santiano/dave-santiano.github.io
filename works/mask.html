		<h1>Anti-Facial Recognition+Scanning Mask</h1>

        <p>
            Here in China, and many places in the world, facial recognition technology is being used  for a variety of purposes. Catching wrong-doers within crowds of thousands and finding lost children in the giant Shanghai city metro system are all noble pursuits, but it comes at the cost of our biometric data being fed into stored in giant databases for purposes like "upholding the values of society". Although this technology advances quite rapidly, there are ways to counteract it in low-tech ways.

            Rudimentary facial recognition is usually done by feature mapping, simply finding pixels that match the general features of a face within an image and then saying "There's a face! I've found it and here's where it is!" Now, with neural networks and 3D capture systems it's a bit more robust and accurate. Now 3D models of faces can be stored
