					In many places in the world <span class = "rainbow_element">facial
					recognition technology</span> is being used  for a variety of
					purposes. Catching wrong-doers within a crowd of ten thousand and
					finding lost children in the giant Shanghai city metro system are
					all noble pursuits, but it comes at the cost of our <span class =
					"rainbow_element">biometric data</span> being stored in giant
					databases. Although this technology advances quite rapidly, there
					are ways to counteract it using <span class="rainbow_element">cheap and low-tech methods</span>.

				<p class="project-description">
					Rudimentary facial recognition is usually done by <span class="rainbow_element">feature mapping</span>,
					simply finding pixels that match the general features of a face
					within an image and returning it's position within it. However,
					these techniques usually yield inconsistent results with many false
					positives. Now, with advancements in <span class =
					"rainbow_element">machine learning based image analysis and 3D
					capture systems</span>, facial recognition has become more robust
					and accurate. Now, <span class="rainbow_element">3D models of faces</span> can be stored and then used to
					train this technology to become more accurate and robust, with very
					little false positives.

					Technical analysis: <span class="rainbow_element">infrared disruption</span> methodology
				</p>
				<p class="project-description">
					In order to disrupt this technology I came up with the idea of a
					mask that not only obscures the face, but also <span class =
					"rainbow_element">disrupts and obscures the depth data</span> being
					received by these volumetric facial recognition cameras. Most
					<span class="rainbow_element">volumetric capture systems</span> utilize
					<span class = "rainbow_element">infrared light projectors</span> to
					calculate depth. Because of this, it is often advised not to have
					reflective surfaces when conducting volumetric capture. <span class
					= "rainbow_element">Exploiting this weakness is the idea behind the
					anti-surveillance mask</span>. <span class =
					"rainbow_element">Retro-reflective material</span> heavily reflects
					back the infrared patterns emitted by the infrared projector on a
					depth camera, flooding the camera with inaccurate data. This results in
					a <span class="rainbow_element">hole being created</span> on the retro-reflective material part of the
					point cloud.
