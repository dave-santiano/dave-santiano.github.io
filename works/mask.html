            Here in China, and many places in the world, <span class =
            "rainbow_element">facial recognition
            technology</span> is being used  for a variety of purposes. Catching
            wrong-doers within a crowd of ten thousand and finding lost children
            in the giant Shanghai city metro system are all noble pursuits, but
            it comes at the cost of our <span class =
            "rainbow_element">biometric data</span> being fed into stored in
            giant databases for purposes like "upholding the values of society".
            Although this technology advances quite rapidly, there are ways to
            counteract it in low-tech ways. 
        </p>

            Rudimentary facial recognition is usually done by feature mapping,
            simply finding pixels that match the general features of a face
            within an image and then saying "There's a face! I've found it and
            here's where it is!" Now, with advancements in machine learning
            based image analysis  and 3D capture systems it has been developed
            to become more robust and accurate. Now, 3D models of faces can be
            stored and then used to train this technology to become more
            accurate. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to disrupt this technology I came up with the idea of a mask
            that not only obscures the face, but also disrupts and obscures the data 
            being received by these volumetric facial recognition cameras.
