		<h1>The Project:</h1>
		<p>
			This project aims to use the Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) to analyze sound in real-time and then present users with a musical scale that could be used to hear the sound of the overtones in their own voice. Other sound sources could be used as well, as long as they are harmonic.
		</p>
		<p>
			Single tones, besides pure sine waves, are made of a composition of tones, called partials. The lowest pitched partial is called the fundamental, which could be the name of a note in a musical context. Partials above, or, over the fundamental are called overtones. Some of these overtones are actually positive integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, which are given the name of harmonics. The sum of all the partials, or parts, of the tone produce that same tone. So, extracting the harmonics and building a scale from them should produce a scale that's harmonic with the original source.
