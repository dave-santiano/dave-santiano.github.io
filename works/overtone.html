		<h1>Overtone Music Generator</h1>

		<p>
			This tool extracts the most prominent overtones within a singular
			sound source and then plays back found tones as a musical scale. The
			motivation behind doing this was due to an increased fascination
			with <span class = "rainbow_element">overtonal music</span>, Ben
			Johnston's absolutely huge work with creating micro-tonal musical
			scales for his string quartet arrangements, throat singing, <span
			class = "rainbow_element">alternative/experimental musical
			scales</span>, and studying the <span class =
			"rainbow_element">fundamental building blocks</span> of the sonic
			soundscape around us.
		</p>
		<p>
			The framework of this project circles around two ideas: 
			<div class = "rainbow_element">
				1. Harmonic/Musical sounds are the sum of many different
				frequencies that give that sound its identity.
			</div> 
			<div class = "rainbow_element">
				2. This set of summable frequencies contain pitches that are
				harmonic with the sound source that created them.
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			Knowing this, I figured that digitally analyzing and capturing these
			harmonic pitches would produce a scale that could be played in
			tandem with the acoustic source that created them. In order to do
			this, I utilized the <span class = "rainbow_element">Fast Fourier
			Transform(FFT)</span>, a tool often used in digital signal
			processing, to find the most prominent overtones/harmonics within a
			sound and them mapped them to my keyboard for playback. Within
			music, the FFT is frequently used in music synthesis, primarily in
			additive synthesis, but here I am using it to break down a sound
			into its parts and then turn it into scales.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even though one can mathematically calculate these scales,
			as they are just integer multiples of the fundamental, I chose to
			utilize this method to do a more individualized analysis. There are
			many sounds that can be called <span class =
			"rainbow_element">inharmonic</span>, meaning that their primary
			overtone frequencies stray from the numerical location of the
			harmonics. Even though these inharmonic frequencies may introduce
			dissonance into the captured scale, they are still fundamentally a
			part of the sound that created them. Instead of focusing on a clean
			and calculated scale that utilizes the accuracy of a mathematical
			formula, I am instead creating a <span class =
			"rainbow_element">musical scale from components</span>.
