		<h1>The Project:</h1>
		<p>
			TeleWindow is an ongoing telepresence research project being
			conducted under the guidance of <a class = "obvious-link" href =
			"http://www.naimark.net/">Michael Naimark</a>. The aim is to explore
			how a two-way, one to one, "telepresence window", can be achieved
			with pre-existing and emerging technology and computational power.
			Utilizing these different ingredients, we can prototype a device
			that can offer features such as two-way eye contact, stereoscopic
			3D, and presence.

		<h1>How it works:</h1>
		<p>			
			Currently, we are using four Intel RealSense depth cameras in order
			to create a volumetric pointcloud representation of a person, and
			then we correct perspective based on the head/eye positions of the
			user. The stereoscopic eye-tracked volumetric display was acquired through
			SeeFront.
