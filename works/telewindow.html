			TeleWindow is a finished experimental telepresence research project
			conducted under the guidance of <a class = "obvious-link" href =
			"http://www.naimark.net/">Michael Naimark</a>. The aim was to explore
			how a two-way, one to one communication, "telepresence window", system can be
			developed and how this system can aid communication in the digital age.
			Utilizing these different ingredients, we can prototype a device
			that can offer features such as 
			<span class = "rainbow_element">two-way eye contact</span>, 
			<span class = "rainbow_element">stereoscopy</span>, and 
			<span class = "rainbow_element">telepresence</span>. 
			All done in 
			<span class = "rainbow_element">realtime</span>.

			Currently, we are using four <span class = "rainbow_element">Intel RealSense</span> cameras in order
			to create a volumetric pointcloud representation of a person, and
			then we correct perspective based on the head/eye positions of the
			user. The stereoscopic eye-tracked volumetric display was acquired through
			SeeFront.
