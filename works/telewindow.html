			TeleWindow is an ongoing telepresence research project being
			conducted under the guidance of <a class = "obvious-link" href =
			"http://www.naimark.net/">Michael Naimark</a>. The aim is to explore
			how a two-way, one to one, "telepresence window", can be achieved
			with pre-existing and emerging technology and computational power.
			Utilizing these different ingredients, we can prototype a device
			that can offer features such as <span class = "rainbow_element">two-way eye contact</span>, 
			<span class = "rainbow_element">stereoscopic
			3D</span>, and <span class = "rainbow_element">presence</span>. All done in <span class = "rainbow_element">
				realtime</span>.

			Currently, we are using four Intel RealSense cameras in order
			to create a volumetric pointcloud representation of a person, and
			then we correct perspective based on the head/eye positions of the
			user. The stereoscopic eye-tracked volumetric display was acquired through
			SeeFront.
