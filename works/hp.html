			<p class="project-description">
				propelland was tasked with updating HP's Customer Welcome Center to
				showcase <span class = "rainbow_element">a more in-context user
				experience, where customers can see HP hardware within the context
				of a real user interfacing with HP products within different work
				environments.</span> As you walk through the new HP Customer Welcome
				Center you can see these environments sorted into different areas
				such as an "Office", a "Home", or a "Gaming" environment. In
				"Office", you'll see printers or videoconferencing hardware, and for
				"Gaming", you can experience streaming setups, gaming hardware, and
				even musical instruments. 
			</p>
			<p class="project-description">
				The new Customer Welcome Center was updated with different activations
				powered by <span class = "rainbow_element">Home Assistant</span>, an
				open-source home automation software that integrates with a variety
				of appliances and IoT devices. For one called <span class="rainbow_element">"Choose Your Persona"</span>,
				<span class = "rainbow_element">we used differently colored Philips
				Hue Lights to highlight sets of products according to which work
				persona would use them.</span> Additionally, <span class =
				"rainbow_element">we added controllable sounds and smells throughout
				the entire space to make a more immersive and interactive
				experience.</span>
