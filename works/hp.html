		<h1>HP Customer Welcome Center</h1>
		<p>
			propelland was tasked with updating HP's Customer Welcome Center to
			showcase <span class = "rainbow_element">a more in-context user
			experience, where customers can see HP hardware within the context
			of a real user interfacing with HP products within different work
			environments.</span> As you walk through the new HP Customer Welcome
			Center you can see these environments sorted into different areas
			such as an "Office", a "Home", or a "Gaming" environment. In
			"Office", you'll see printers or videoconferencing hardware, and for
			"Gaming", you can experience streaming setups, gaming hardware, and
			even musical instruments. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The new Customer Welcome Center was updated with different activations
			powered by <span class = "rainbow_element">Home Assistant</span>, an
			open-source home automation software that integrates with a variety
			of appliances and IoT devices. For one called "Choose Your Persona",
			<span class = "rainbow_element">we used differently colored Philips
			Hue Lights to highlight sets of products according to which work
			persona would use them.</span> Additionally, <span class =
			"rainbow_element">we added controllable sounds and smells throughout
			the entire space to make a more immersive and interactive
			experience.</span>
		</p>
		

		<div style = "margin: 8px 0px">
			<video class = " video-js vjs-big-play-centered vjs-fluid project_image" controls
			preload = "auto" width="900px" data-setup="{}">
				<source src="/techimg/hp-1.webm" type="video/webm">
			</video>
		</div>
		<p>
			In this particular interaction, "Choose Your Persona", <span class =
			"rainbow_element">personas were identified and created to represent
			users that would benefit from the products that exist within the
			model co-working space.</span> Examples of some of the personas that
			were created are "Tech Experts", "Creative Experts", "Office
			Collaborators", etc. <span class = "rainbow_element">We had the
			lights and personas activated by custom ID cards, each one
			representing a different persona to be highlighted.</span>
		</p>
		<div style = "margin: 8px 0px">
			<video class = " video-js vjs-big-play-centered vjs-fluid project_image" controls
			preload = "auto" width="900px" data-setup="{}">
				<source src="/techimg/hp-2.webm" type="video/webm">
			</video>
		</div>
		<p>
			The cards are scanned by a <span class = "rainbow_element">NFC tag
			reader</span> and we also added control cards to turn them all on or
			off and to reset them. The primary user for these cards would be a
			tour guide that would guide customers through the space.
		</p>
		<img class="project_image" src="../techimg/hp-3.jpg">
		<p>
			Everything was built to be easily customizable and accessible, so
			that the system can be modified when different needs arise.
		</p>

		<img class="project_image" src="../techimg/hp-4.jpg">
		<p>
			<span class = "rainbow_element">Sounds and smells</span> were added
			and placed throughout the space as well. Sounds were
			controlled by Sonos speakers attached to Home Assistant, where local
			sound files were being hosted. Smells were controlled by a smart
			plug attached to a Wi-Fi connected aroma diffusers from Pura. 
		</p>
		<img class="project_image" width= "800px" src="../techimg/hp-5.jpg">
		<p>
			Overall, the new Customer Welcome Center has been augmented with a
			multi-sensory experience, sights, sounds, and smells that <span
			class = "rainbow_element">enable HP customers to look at HP products
			within a context that they will actually be used in. This allows
			customers to get closer to how real users will use HP
			products.</span>
