		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>
			Hi! My name is <span class = "rainbow_element">David Santiano</span>
			and I was previously working as a research associate for telepresence
			at New York University Shanghai's
			<span class = "rainbow_element">Interactive Media Arts</span>
			department. Along with that I
			helped teach a class called <a href = "../works/vrar_fund.html" class
			= "obvious-link rainbow_element">VR/AR Fundamentals</a>, where
			students learned about the fundamentals of immersive media. Now, most 
			of my time is taken up by scrappy, artsy, and explorative 
			research and experimentation.  I also
			make and produce music on the side. If you want to contact me in any way
			please feel free to reach out.
