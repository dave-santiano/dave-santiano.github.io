		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>
				Hi! I am David Santiano, and I am currently working as a fellow at New York University Shanghai's
				Interactive Media Arts department. Right now, I am exploring and learning different ways to remix, hack, and break
				various emerging technologies in order to assist and inspire. I am also interested in a wide variety of other 
				disciplines in the visual arts, including photography, animation, and 3D modeling. Aurally, I play guitar, bass, and 
				produce a bit of my own music on the side. My current works in progress involve works that sit at
				the cross-roads of the auditory, visual, and emerging
				arts, a little preview of what's to come. Reach out to me if you want to collaborate or contact me:
